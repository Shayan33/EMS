There are two tables, Student and Session. There is a @ManyToMany relation between them. I used oracle express, and JPA hibernate. The simple folder doesn't have any UI. Everything appears in the console. Complicated one has JavaFX UI, and there are client and server connection with RMI. I implemented just one function for complicated mode
