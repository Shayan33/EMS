There are two tables, Student and Session. 
there is @ManyToMany relation between them. I used oracle express and JPA hibernate. 
simple folder don't have any UI. everything appears in console.
complicated one have javaFX UI and there is client and server connection with RMI.
I implemented just one function for complicated mode.
